# Features
[ ] Create and Add Pillar Icons - I found limitations in svg and canvas ability to display text, which was the original idea. There are third parties that exist [zfont](https://jaames.github.io/zfont/). There are workaround such as (https://github.com/metafizzy/zdog/issues/16) [paper.JS to import svg] or even using pixels such as in this pen (https://codepen.io/eerk/pen/PvMqej). 

    While it seems possible to render with text like my initial plan, I think the text wouldn't blend very well with the fluid animation. I think an attempt at creating an icon should be done either way. I am thinking the three symbols could be:
        {} or üíª - Software
        üìö or üìï - Academic
        Compass or üìê - Engineering
    
    Good links for inspiration: [Zdog-demos](https://codepen.io/collection/nZrQqe/?cursor=ZD0wJm89MCZwPTEmdj00)


# Refactor
[ ] Make canvas/svg globally accessible
[ ] make zdog library globally accessible
[ ] Convert pillar.js into vue syntax - could be implemented as empty div's without css. This should be researched if some sub-svg / sub-canvas element can be used or if there is another commonly used vue syntax for vue components without a clear html representation.
[ ] Convert icon.js into vue syntax


# Issues
[ ] Rotation skips after running ~1.5 Revolutions. Something is off with the math of calculating angles and degrees per revolution. After reading how other's animation loops were implemented, I think the issue is due to how I tied angle to be part of the animation loop. I should maintain a seperate count variable, and tie into the count a rotation and sum angle variable.

# Other
[ ] Deploy dev code to server for demo's and sharing.
